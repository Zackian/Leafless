        <h2>Company</h2>
        <h3>Who We Are</h3>
        <p>Leafless I/S was founded by two software developers with a shared passion for games and digital experiences. We met during our studies at Dania Academy in Grenaa, completing both the Computer Science (Datamatiker) program and a Professional Bachelor in Software Development. Our shared ambition: to create our own games from idea to finished product.</p>
        <h3>How Leafless Started</h3>
        <p>In 2017, we launched Leafless Entertainment during an internship program, where we developed our first mobile game, Colorz. The project guided us through a full development cycle — from concept to release, teaching us the importance of finishing what we start.</p>
        <h3>Becoming Leafless I/S</h3>
        <p>As we grew, we rebranded to Leafless I/S and shifted focus to more ambitious projects. Since 2019, we’ve been developing our platformer, Gribley’s Grudge. The game has evolved through multiple design directions, helping us refine our vision.</p>
